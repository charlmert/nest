The running name for the do once never again platform.

should be cloudable infrastructure for the placement of salsa cases
indexed and seachable according to loosley coupled critereon

once a usable case is found against a match for octoplasm it should
be executed and logged for further training exercises.

Can be seen as a series of scaffolds other users can jump on to
continue building rather than reinventing the wheel.

research>	Will need to jump into design considerations of oop and
				  other engine detail under the bonnet hiding methedologies

Hence will serve as the reusable solution platform.
Cases should be heiarchially structured e.g.
	A case for scaffolding (parent case):
	- network configuration for a particular set of nodes
	  the solution can be analyzed by salsa with a network monitor
          and system monitor as instructors.

reserch> The heiarchially will possibly lend to automated taxonomy or classification.
         when defining a name for a parent category the system should take into account
         the meta information and other sig based info from the contents or context of
         what is being defined.

         hence hash/sig algos need to scale, these hashes will be used to group certain
         sets of definitions and or their implementations and the hashes will only be renamed
         to human consumable format, text, whould it be required.

         for the process of naming the chef script from callcenter_deploy.sh should be named so
         when it needs to be consumed or modified by humans.
