salsa behavioral profiler - bash history

Thanks to this guy: http://www.cuberick.com/2008/11/update-bash-history-in-realtime.html
I can now maintain bash history accross terminals and have users with bash as their terminal
listed as instructors to salsa.

Use Case 1: (use cases will form the "do once, never again knowledge base")
Simple installation of Symfony could be done once and never again.
you type in a series of commands (luckily it's possible to go very far in the console with symfony
to create your web app) to create or generate your web app.

The goal is to have salsa capture every part of this (short of being a privacy sensitive key logger)
and have relative paths/steps/requirements (short of a debug memory dump/environment snapshot) captured, 
tagged according to a taxonomy system and have the entire symfony app creation process 
reproduced by entering a few labels into octoplasm.
