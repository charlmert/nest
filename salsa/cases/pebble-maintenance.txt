BUG REPORTS
       If  you  find  a bug in bash, you should report it.  But first, you should make sure that it really is a bug, and that it appears in the latest version of
       bash.  The latest version is always available from ftp://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/bash/.

       Once you have determined that a bug actually exists, use the bashbug command to submit a bug report.  If you have a fix, you are encouraged to  mail  that
       as well!  Suggestions and `philosophical' bug reports may be mailed to bug-bash@gnu.org or posted to the Usenet newsgroup gnu.bash.bug.

       ALL bug reports should include:

       The version number of bash
       The hardware and operating system
       The compiler used to compile
       A description of the bug behaviour
       A short script or `recipe' which exercises the bug

       bashbug inserts the first three items automatically into the template it provides for filing a bug report.

       Comments and bug reports concerning this manual page should be directed to chet.ramey@case.edu.

BUGS
       It's too big and too slow.

       There are some subtle differences between bash and traditional versions of sh, mostly because of the POSIX specification.

       Aliases are confusing in some uses.

       Shell builtin commands and functions are not stoppable/restartable.

       Compound  commands  and  command  sequences  of  the  form `a ; b ; c' are not handled gracefully when process suspension is attempted.  When a process is
       stopped, the shell immediately executes the next command in the sequence.  It suffices to place the sequence of commands between parentheses to  force  it
       into a subshell, which may be stopped as a unit.

       Array variables may not (yet) be exported.

       There may be only one active coprocess at a time.
