Minimal to Non intrusive unit testing framework

Take the continuedness of ci combined with the unit level to functional
testing combined with a pin and baloon prick and you have, baloon.

A unit testing framework attempting to test function from the outside with
a set of pins known to pop or break the baloon.

The non intrusive tests will be implemented purley as a set of external
functional tests with aims to minimal system overhead and impact only
the areas meant to test with the maximum set of exposed interface useage.

This will enable system specifications to open up interfaces to possibly
unknown, needed areas of requrired functional test spectural. i.e. open
up and expose interfaces to the depth and resolution required for the pin
to prick the baloon hard enough to pop

Baloon, because CI is really really old
